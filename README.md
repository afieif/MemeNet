The task at hand is to classify the following meme templates : Spiderman, Drake & Mr. Incredibles, as for the reason? there isn't one really, I did this as a learning exercise to be honest.

## Finally we threw in some wildcards , just out of curiosity we tested it on some variants that were considerably different from the images in the training set
